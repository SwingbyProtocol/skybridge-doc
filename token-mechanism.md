# What is the SWINGBY token?

Swingby Skybridge is fueled by a token named "Swingby Token" \(or "[SWINGBY](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/swingby)"\). 

SWINGBY runs as a [BEP-2 token on the Binance Chain](https://explorer.binance.org/asset/SWINGBY-888). It is primarily used to prove eligibility to participate in a TSS group and represents the financial commitment \(**'the bond'**\) for network validators to behave properly. 

In addition, this token has also been distributed to foster the growth of the Swingby network ecosystem. Future plans include the Swingby token to be issued on other blockchains \(as a peg i.e., not affecting the total token supply\) that will be be connected to Swingby Skybridge.

### **A financial bond** 

Swingby Skybridge is designed as a permissionless network where no central authority can determine who can participate in a group or not. To do so, Swingby Skybridge node operators \( **'metanodes'**\) must prove that they own SWINGBY tokens on Binance Chain, and lock \(or stake\) them for as long as they intend to participate in a TSS group. 

To join a TSS group, a participant must acquire SWINGBY and have owned it for a period of time. Then, these parties can prove this when TSS rounds \(including public key creation and the signing events\) occur.

Nodes are selected to participate in signing \(and earn fees\) based on their seniority, indicating how long the node has been operational. 

A node will start accrue up-time once it fulfills the peer requirements and is connected to the network. It is a simple seniority prioritization and thus different from coin-age; a node need to fulfill the SWINGBY stake required, but adding more tokens on top of that will not affect its priority. 

Furthermore, removing SWINGBY tokens for a metanode to go below the staking threshold resets its seniority to zero. The trade-off is that early adopter nodes are difficult to out-compete as long as they stay honest, potentially discouraging "young" nodes to join as standby. On the upside, it prevents late joiners to gain majority control by abusing a large stack of SWINGBY tokens. Instead, younger nodes becomes encouraged to set up new bridges for tokens in demand to gain seniority as early adopters on that swap pair.

### **Additional use cases**

Swingby SWINGBY tokens will also continue to be added for additional use cases that are being [incorporated in new SWIPs](https://github.com/SwingbyProtocol/swips).

Currently, there are discussions to include use cases, such as:

* **Governance asset** — SWINGBY holders could submit governance proposals to be implemented by the team by using their tokens to decide the **future of Skybridge** \(and other protocols from Swingby\).
* **Fee reduction —** token holders could receive a swap fee discount by staking/burning tokens.

### Token distribution **and circulation**

**Pre-staking**

Early adopters have the option to lock tokens for a bonus reward \(see [Pre-staking]()\). These rewarded tokens come from reserved ecosystem tokens and will increase circulating supply of SWINGBY over time. This token distribution schedule is independent from the token market price, network activity, fees, and any sort of expenses.

**Full node staking**

Participating as a full node \("metanodes"\) require both dedicated server resources and meeting the SWINGBY token requirement. Full nodes participate in signing transactions to receive the fees incurred by those transactions. Please remember that nodes are selected based on their age, and removing SWINGBY token stake from the node **resets the age to zero**.
