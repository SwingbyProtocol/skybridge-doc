# BNB Staking Campaign

You can participate in BNB staking campaign by sending BNB to your own address with a memo. You control your own tokens during the staking. This is the same process as SWINGBY Pre-staking that is soon to be released.

There are two guides below; one for using Binance DEX and one for using Trust Wallet \(mobile app\).



### How to stake \(basic, [B](https://trustwallet.com/)inance DEX\)

1. Navigate to [https://stake.swingby.network/](https://stake.swingby.network/)
2. Enter the public address \(BEP-2\) that holds your BNB tokens in the top field and click "Set Address".

5. Enter the amount of tokens that you would like to stake and click on "Confirm".  
_Optional: You can choose to vote for a currency as next trading pair. Memo code will change if you select to vote, everything else is the same._

6. Save the Confirmation window for use in later steps by keeping the window open or taking a screenshot. 

We recommend to keep the window open to receive staking status feedback automatically at later steps.

7. Login on Binance DEX, [https://www.binance.org/](https://www.binance.org/) with the wallet you entered as public address.

8. Send the amount of SWINGBY tokens to your own address with the memo, as seen in the previous confirmation screen. **NOTE**: You will need a small extra amount of BNB tokens to pay for network fee.

10. **DO NOT** send any BNB tokens from that address before you received your rewards! If you do, it will cancel the staking. You will need to redo the staking from start again and reward will be counted from the new staking time instead.
