# Summary

## Overview

Swingby Skybridge is a staking powered decentralized bridging protocol for the cross-chain movement of crypto assets. It enables fast trustless bridges between the Bitcoin blockchain, Ethereum, and other distributed ledgers.

Swingby Skybridge uses advanced cryptography that builds on modern multi-party threshold signature schemes, allowing support for efficient, dealer-less key generation, and distributed computation of ECDSA and EdDSA digital signatures.

Swingby Skybridge implements a layer-2 proof-of-stake consensus system and peer-to-peer network to facilitate inter-blockchain swaps using TSS cryptography and MPC computation.

### Decentralized token bridges

Swingby Skybridge is a network consisting of clusters of nodes that manage decentralized wallets using threshold signatures \("TSS"\) cryptography to **form multiparty signature wallets** and use those to **facilitate cross-chain token swaps**.

With Skybridge, cryptographic assets can be transferred from one blockchain to another and as fast as their block times. Skybridge does not require any third party to be trusted and no single person \(or centralized entity\) has access to the deposit while they are being swapped.

Completing a swap on Swingby Skybridge is as **easy as transferring the assets to an address** and there is no need to use any sort of special wallet application.

### **Modern cryptography applied made simple for all**

By using the latest cutting-edge research, Skybridge is an innovative solution built on complex cryptography that remains extremely **simple to use for all DeFi users**. 

In contrast, traditional approaches to similar problems have used complex multi-signature transactions and script op-code methods like Hash Time-Lock Contracts \(HTLCs\), which are not widely supported by wallets and other user interfaces.

Swingby Skybridge applies modern cryptography for the real world to address gaps in the cross-chain DeFi ecosystem by making it **easy for anyone to move assets across blockchain networks**.
