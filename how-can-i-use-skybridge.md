# How can I use Skybridge?

There are three types of participants in a Skybridge network:

1. **Metanodes** – they stake SWINGBY to participate in swaps will receive swap _fee / n_. This process is also known as 'bonding'.
2. **Liquidity providers** – they deposit one of the two bridged assets \(e.g., WBTC/BTC\) in the 'float' to receive swap fees that are proportional to their deposited amount of tokens. Any party can do this without any requirement to operate a metanode. This process is also known as 'float staking'.
3. **Users -** they move assets between blockchains. These can transfer BTC to Ethereum \(through WBTC at first\) and vice versa, by paying a network fee that is collected by both metanodes and liquidity providers.

### What are metanodes?

Swingby's Skybridge node operators \('metanodes'\) incur two primary costs: 

1. **Operational costs** for running a node, e.g., server costs.
2. **Staking costs** since they have to purchase and hold SWINGBY tokens that are bonded to their full node. This bond helps them secure the network and align network interests with their financial stake.

### What is float staking and what are Skybridge liquidity providers?

Float staking is a concept specific to Skybridge networks. Deposits on both source blockchain and target blockchains are used to allow for simple swaps, thus, reducing the swap fee to be as **low as possible for users**.

Larger deposits allow efficient swaps, and possibly more important, comfortability in using the bridged token on the target blockchain, as the user is able to swap back to source blockchain at any time. In short, these deposits are “lent” to the bridge and an opportunity cost for depositing tokens need to be considered.

Deposit based Skybridge need to provide sufficient interest on tokens so make it an attractive option for token holders. A portion of the swap fees are captured and distributed in order to reward depositors.

### Who are the users?

Users are individuals and corporations wishing to move their BTCs to pegged tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
