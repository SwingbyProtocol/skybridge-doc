# Peer requirements

The following minimum requirements \(hardware and wallets\) are suggested in order to run the full node software:

1. Runs in Docker container \(STC preferred\) on good hardware
2. Fast and stable network connection but can be located anywhere
3. Stake of Swingby tokens \(cold wallet\) for minimum 72 hours.

   _Have to self-send memo signed by peer P2P key to prove ownership and NOT move the tokens, otherwise other peers will ignore you._

4. A BTC "rewards" address on the Bitcoin chain.
