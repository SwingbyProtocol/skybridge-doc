The Swingby Network is a permissionless \(ie, anyone can join by downloading and running the Swingby node software\), peer-to-peer \(ie, all nodes are equal and there is no leader\) network of nodes who run the Swingby node software to communicate with one another.

The network exists to create and operate decentralised custodians. TSS groups form on the network, which runs two main processes.  First, the keygen process which is the collaborative creation of a public key, from which custodial cryptocurrency addresses on both blockchains are derived.  This is an initial set-up phase and is done once per “bridge” between two blockchains. Second, the transaction signing process which is the collaborative signing of cryptocurrency transactions for making payments from those custodial addresses.  Both processes are implemented using the TSS protocol. TSS groups can reform as nodes leave and join the network. This is known as dynamic re-grouping.
